## SRTP

SRTP encryption is negotiated during SDP offer/answer. The SDK automatically selects the strongest mutually supported crypto suite. No manual key management is required.

## Jitter Buffer

An adaptive jitter buffer smooths out network packet reordering and delay variation. The target delay adjusts automatically based on observed network conditions.

## RTCP

RTCP Sender Reports and Receiver Reports are sent every 5 seconds. Quality metrics (packet loss, jitter, round-trip time) are available via `call.GetRtcpQuality()`.
